# dogmatist
Dogmatist is a simple framework for specifying the structure of one or more
objects and arrays and the relations between those object and arrays.

## Documentation
You can find the documentation [here](docs/).

## Requirements

* PHP 5.5+
* Composer

## Installation
To install dogmatist as a non-dev requirement for your project use:

    composer require bravesheep/dogmatist=dev-master

Or if you only need dogmatist during development (i.e. testing), which seems to
be more likely, use:

    composer require --dev bravesheep/dogmatist=dev-master
